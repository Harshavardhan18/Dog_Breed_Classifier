# Dog_Breed_Classifier

Dog breed categorization is a very specific application of convolutional neural networks. It falls under the category of fine-grained image classification problem, where inter-class variations are small and often one small part of the image considered makes the difference in the classification. The project aims to use an open-source neural-network library written in python on top of tensorflow called keras to define a convolutional neural network to train and categorize dog breeds using CNNs.

## Instructions and tips you can follow:

1.  Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder or you can download the dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data). *If you are downloading from kaggle please do split the dataset into test, train and validation sets*

2.  Basic Knowledge on 
    * Python
    * keras
    * How image classification works
    * Machine Learning
    
3.  If you do not have a GPU laptop you may prefer to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) as an alteranative solution to work on Deep learning they provide free GPU(Tesla k-80) and RAM(12 GB).

4. Open the `Dog_Breed_Classifier.ipnb` and follow the instruction to execute the program. Each cell has comments that explains the objective/purpose of the cells.
